Despite their power, epic spells still follow the basic rules for casting spells, except as specifically noted otherwise. Epic casters can manipulate the seeds of true magic, but knowing the seeds and how to manipulate them does not instantly grant ultimate power. Each epic spell must be laboriously developed before it can be used.</para><para/>

The process of development can be a time-consuming and expensive process. It is during development that a caster determines whether a given epic spell lies within his or her abilities or beyond them. The basis of that determination lies in an epic spell's Spellcraft DC.</para><para>The easiest way to develop an epic spell is to use one already given. The description of each of these unique spells gives the amount of gold, time, and experience points required to develop the spell.

A developed epic spell becomes an indelible part of the caster and may be prepared without a spellbook (if a wizard is the caster). Characters who cast spells spontaneously, such as sorcerers, can cast a developed epic spell by using any open epic spell slot. Druids, clerics, and similar spellcasters can likewise prepare epic spells using epic spell slots.</para><para>A spellcaster can prepare or cast any epic spell he or she knows as many times per day as he or she has available epic spell slots. A spellcaster who can cast epic spells has a number of open epic spell slots per day equal to one-tenth his or her ranks in the Knowledge skill appropriate to the spell and the caster's class. Knowledge (arcana) is appropriate for arcane casters, and Knowledge (religion) or Knowledge (nature) is appropriate for divine casters. The rules for rest between casting a day's allotment of epic spells are the same as for rest required to prepare standard spells. If the caster doesn't use up a day's allotment of epic spell slots, the unused slots remain available whether or not the spellcaster receives appropriate rest.</para><para>Even if the epic spell has been developed and an epic spell slot is available, successfully casting an epic spell isn't assured. The caster's Spellcraft skill modifier is vital for casting an epic spell. To cast an epic spell, a spellcaster makes a Spellcraft check against the epic spell's Spellcraft DC. If the check succeeds, the spell is cast. If the caster fails the check, the epic spell fizzles and the epic spell slot is used for the day.</para><para>Because epic spells require Spellcraft checks, a spell is beyond the caster's ability if the final Spellcraft DC is greater than 20 + the spellcaster's Spellcraft modifier. Epic spells with DCs higher than 10 + the spellcaster's Spellcraft modifier are risky; a caster can take 10 when casting an epic spell, but he or she can't take 20. When routinely casting epic spells, most spellcasters take 10 on their Spellcraft checks.</para><topic level="8" name="Epic Spell Levels" origname="Epic Spell Levels" linkname="Spells_Epic_Spells_Acquiring_Epic_Spells_Epic_Spellcasting_Epic_Spell_Levels" docbookid="EpicSpells6" refname="Epic Spell Levels" reftype="other" refcase="yes" refaltname="" keywords="acquir,epic,level,spell,spellcast"><para reftype="other" refcase="yes" refname="Epic Spell Levels"><b>Epic Spell Levels:</b> Epic spells have no fixed level.

This swarm forms a living aura around the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or her own <i>crown of vermin</i>. The swarm goes where the character goes at his or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the <i>crown of vermin</i> bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who fall prey to the <i>crown of vermin</i>. The vermin have damage reduction 1/epic, so the vermin's natural weapons are treated as epic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren't enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell's effect, the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is distributed among the survivors equally.</para><para>The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her aura, and can force them into areas that would normally deter common vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell's duration. Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius spread as a move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from the character's control through any means. The vermin make all saving throws to avoid damaging effects using the character's base saving throw bonuses. They gain the character's spell resistance, if any, and they get saving throws against spells that would otherwise automatically slay vermin. A character can see through his or her <i>crown of vermin</i> without difficulty, but gains one-half concealment against enemy attacks launched both outside and within the character's <i>crown of vermin</i>.</para><para/>

Treat the duplicate as the character with a number of negative levels conferred that would lower him or her to the character level of the eidolon. The eidolon is considered fresh and rested when created. It may cast any spell the character has access to, including an epic spell. Use the eidolon's Spellcraft modifier as the basis for the number of epic spells it can cast in a day, and its effective character level as a basis for its skills, feats, and other abilities. The eidolon is effectively lower level than the character and probably can't cast all the spells he or she knows. A powerful enough eidolon might conceivably cast the <i>eidolon</i> spell itself. The eidolon appears in whatever mundane clothing the character desires when initially conjured, but it has no other possessions. It shares part of the character's soul, so it is the character for all intents and purposes. The character and his or her <i>eidolon</i> communicate with each other normally. Usually, the eidolon does not begrudge its brief existence, because it is still part of the character. If the eidolon is killed prior to the expiration of the spell's duration, the character immediately regains the lost levels.

If the creature has no language, the character can communicate only basic commands. The character knows what the subject is experiencing, but does not receive direct sensory input from it. A subject forced to take an action against its nature receives a saving throw with a penalty of -10 to resist taking that particular action, but if it succeeds, it still remains the character's thrall despite its minor mutiny. Once a subject makes a successful saving throw to resist a specific order, it makes all future saving throws to resist taking that specific action without a penalty. <i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell can prevent the character from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject is so protected, but it does not prevent the establishment of <i>enslave</i> or dispel it.</para><para><i>XP Cost:</i> 2,000 XP.</para><para/>

When the character casts the spell, a stroke of energy deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to each creature within the spell's area. <i>Living lightning</i> follows all the standard rules for epic spell casting when the character casts it. <i>Living lightning</i> is sentient and generally friendly toward the character. It has the character's mental ability scores, but it has no physical ability scores. It senses the world through the character's senses and communicates with him or her by thought. As a self-triggering spell, it isn't truly alive but is a fragment of the character's personality. It cares little for the world around it, but at the character's urging (and sometimes at its own discretion) it casts itself at his or her foes. Casters who prepare spells before casting must prepare <i>Living lightning</i> normally in order for it to cast itself. When the spell casts itself, it acts on the character's initiative but does not count against his or her own actions in the round. The character cannot simultaneously cast <i>Living lightning</i> while it is casting its own effect, even if it has been prepared more than once. <i>Living lightning</i> uses up one of the character's epic spell slots for the day whenever it casts itself.

For 20 rounds, the dream larva's body physically replaces the character's, though the dream larva has the character's equipment. The dream larva is free to call on all its own powers and abilities, or use the character's equipment. The character's consciousness and physical form are suppressed for the duration of the possession. The character has no way to dismiss the spell, communicate, or otherwise maintain awareness once possession has commenced. The dream larva, temporarily freed from its imprisonment in some distant nightmare, will attempt to slay and incapacitate any creature it can see or find, whether it is a friend or foe of the caster. Casting <i>lord of nightmares</i> entails some risk for the caster, since it's unknown what a dream larva might do over the course of 20 rounds. The larva will dispatch all enemies it can find before turning to its own concerns. Sometimes a dream larva will attempt to place itself in a dangerous or precarious situation prior to the end of the spell, leaving the caster to extricate him or herself. If the dream larva is slain during the duration of the spell, the character's consciousness is instantly restored to aware-ness within his or her own body. The character's condition remains what it was when he or she completed casting <i>lord of nightmares</i>, regardless of what damage the dream larva received. However, magic item charges used, potions consumed, and other physical resources used up by the dream larva are permanent.</para><para><i>XP Cost:</i> 1,000 XP.</para><para/>

The character's future self is technically only a possible future self (the time stream is a maelstrom of multiple probabilities), but snatching that future self from 1 round in the future collapses probability, and the possible future becomes the definite future. The character and his or her future self are both free to act normally this round (the character has already used up the limit of one quickened spell per round, but his or her duplicate hasn't). The future self has all the resources the character has at the moment he or she finishes casting <i>time duplicate</i>. Because the future self was previously only a possibility, his or her resources are not depleted as a result of whatever might occur this round (even if the character dies this round). Likewise, he or she doesn't have any special knowledge of what might occur during this round. Because the future self is still part of the time stream, the round it spends with the character is a round it misses in its own future. Because the chracter's future duplicate is also the character, the character misses the next round as well. He or she simply isn't there. Tampering with the time stream is a tricky business. Here is a round-by-round summary.</para><para><i>Round One:</i> The character casts <i>time duplicate</i>, the future self from round two arrives, and both act normally.</para><para><i>Round Two:</i> The future self-the character-gets snatched back in time to help the past self. During this round, there are no versions of the character present.</para><para><i>Round Three:</i> The character rejoins the time stream. The character arrives in the same location and condition that the future self ended with at the end of the first round. Any resources (spells, damage, staff charges) the future self used up in round one are gone for real. Record them now. Using this spell to snatch a single future self stretches time and probability to its limit; more powerful versions of <i>time duplicate</i> are not possible. A character cannot bring more than a single future version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character snatch a version of him or her from farther in the future.</para><para/>

Every epic seed has a base Spellcraft DC, and every factor has a Spell-craft DC adjustment. When a desired spell is developed, the spellcaster spends resources and time to assemble the pieces that make up the epic spell. The base Spellcraft DCs of each seed are added together; then the DC adjustments of the factors are added to that total. The sum equals the final Spellcraft DC for the epic spell.</para><para>The final Spellcraft DC is the most significant gauge of the epic spell's power. A spellcaster attempts to cast an epic spell by making a Spellcraft check against the epic spell's Spellcraft DC. Thus, a spellcaster knows immediately, based on his or her own Spellcraft bonus, what epic spells are within his or her capability to cast, which are risky, and which are beyond him or her. Epic casters don't commit time and money to develop epic spells until they are powerful enough to cast them.</para><para>An epic spell developed by an arcane spellcaster is arcane, and an epic spell developed by a divine spellcaster is divine. A character who can cast both divine and arcane epic spells chooses whether a particular spell he or she develops will be arcane or divine. If that same caster uses the <i>heal</i> or <i>life</i> seed in an epic spell, that spell is always considered divine. All the epic spells described here can be developed independently by a character who spends the necessary time, money, and experience points. Alternatively, a character can use those spells as a starting point when creating customized versions of the spells.</para><para/><topic level="8" name="Table: Epic Seeds" origname="Table: Epic Seeds" linkname="Spells_Epic_Spells_Developing_Epic_Spells_Table_Epic_Seeds" docbookid="EpicSpells71" refname="Table: Epic Seeds" reftype="other" refcase="yes" refaltname="" keywords="develop,epic,se,spell,tabl"><para reftype="other" refcase="yes" refname="Table: Epic Seeds"><b>Table: Epic Seeds</b> </para><table>

These spells are called rituals. An epic spell developed as a ritual requires a specific number of additional participants, who each must use up one spell slot of a specified level for the day. During an epic spell's development, the spell's creator determines the number of additional participants and the level of the spell slots to be contributed. If the exact number of spellcasters does not partake in the casting, or if the casters do not each contribute the proper spell slot, the epic spell automatically fails. To participate, each participant readies an action to contribute his or her raw spell energy when the primary caster begins the epic spell. Additional participants in a ritual spell reduce the Spellcraft DC, as shown on Table: Additional Participants in Rituals. Each additional participant may only contribute one spell slot. It doesn't matter whether the additional participants are arcane or divine spellcasters; only the level of the spell slot contributed matters. A contributed spell slot is treated as if normally cast. A wizard may contribute either a prepared, uncast spell slot, or an open, unprepared slot. The Spellcraft DC adjustments for each additional participant stack.</para><para><i>Special:</i> A ritual epic spell that takes longer than 1 standard action to cast requires all extra participants to stand as if casting for the same amount of time. If an extra participant is attacked while contributing a spell slot, the participant must make a Concentration check as if casting a spell of the same level as the slot contributed. If the attack disrupts the participant in the ritual, the epic spell is not necessarily ruined. However, the Spellcraft DC reduction that would have been provided by that additional participant cannot be applied to the final Spellcraft DC of the epic spell. Thus the ritual epic spell will be harder for the primary spellcaster to cast.</para><para/>

The <i>Dispel</i> seed can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells, and it affects spell-like effects just as it affects spells. One creature, object, or spell is the target of the <i>Dispel</i> seed. The caster makes a dispel check against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. A dispel check is 1d20 + 10 against a DC of 11 + the target spell's caster level. For each additional +1 on the dispel check, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1.

The caster can cast the energy forth as a bolt, imbue an object with the energy, or create a freestanding manifestation of the energy. If the spell developed using the <i>energy</i> seed releases a bolt, that bolt instantaneously deals 10d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type, and all in the bolt's area must make a Reflex save for half damage. For each additional 1d6 points of damage dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The bolt begins at the caster's fingertips. To imbue another creature with the ability to use an energy bolt as a spell-like ability at its option or when a particular condition is met, increase the Spellcraft DC by +25. The caster can also cause a creature or object to emanate the specific energy type out to a radius of 10 feet for 20 hours. The emanated energy deals 2d6 points of energy damage per round against unprotected creatures (the target creature is susceptible if not separately warded or otherwise resistant to the energy). For each additional 1d6 points of damage emanated, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. The caster may also create a wall, half-circle, circle, dome, or sphere of the desired energy that emanates the energy for up to 20 hours. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves of energy, dealing 2d4 points of energy damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of energy damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and in each round that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6+20 points of energy damage to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. For each additional 1d4 points of damage, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.</para><para>The caster can also use the <i>energy</i> seed to create a spell that carefully releases and balances the emanation of cold, electricity, and fire, creating specific weather effects for a period of 20 hours.

Ordinarily, a caster can't directly target a creature or object, though indirect effects are possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat waves, thunderstorms, fogs, blizzards-even a tornado that moves randomly in the affected area.

Natural abilities include armor, natural weapons, and similar gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth), and possibly hardness.

Objects transformed into creatures gain that creature's average physical ability scores, but are considered to have mental ability scores of 0 (the <i>fortify</i> seed can add points to each mental ability, if desired).

The base use of the <i>Transport</i> seed provides instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. To shift the transportation medium to another medium increase the Spellcraft DC by +2.

Only objects worn or carried (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance. For a spell intended to transport unwilling creatures, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4.

If the caster moves him or herself, or the subject, into a slower time stream for 5 rounds, time ceases to flow for the subject, and its condition becomes fixed-no force or effect can harm it until the duration expires. If the caster moves him or her self into a faster time stream, the caster speeds up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds of apparent time. Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still harm the caster. While the caster is in the fast time stream, other creatures are invulnerable to his or her attacks and spells; however, the caster can create spell effects and leave them to take effect when he or she reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of time, epic spells used to transport a subject into a faster time stream cannot be made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be extended. More simply, the seed can <i>haste</i> or <i>slow</i> a subject for 20 rounds by transporting it to the appropriate time stream. This decreases the Spellcraft DC by -4.</para><para/>

Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</para><para>A ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere (with radius 10 feet) that surrounds the caster and excludes all spell effects of up to 1st level. Alternatively, the caster can ward just the target and not create the radius effect. For each additional level of spells to be excluded, increase the Spellcraft DC by +20 (but see below). The area or effect of any such spells does not include the area of the ward, and such spells fail to affect any target within the ward. This includes spell-like abilities and spells or spell-like effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to the protected area without penalty (unless the spell specifically targets a creature and does not provide a radius effect). The ward could be brought down by a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell. Epic spells using the <i>Dispel</i> seed may bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check. The ward may also be brought down with a targeted epic spell using the <i>Destroy</i> seed if the enemy spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check.</para><para>Instead of creating an epic spell that uses the <i>Ward</i> seed to nullify all spells of a given level and lower, the caster can create a ward that nullifies a specific spell (or specific set of spells).

Demiplanes created by this power are very small, very minor planes.</para><para>A character can only cast this spell while on the Ethereal Plane. When he or she casts the spell, a local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane grows at a rate of 1 foot in radius per day to an initial maximum radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from surrounding ethereal vapors and protomatter.</para><para>The spellcaster determines the environment within the demiplane when he or she first casts <i>genesis</i>, <i/> reflecting most any desire the spellcaster can visualize. The spellcaster determines factors such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the terrain. This spell cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and so forth). The spellcaster must add these things in some other fashion if he or she desires. Once the basic demiplane reaches its maximum size, the spellcaster can continue to cast this spell to enlarge the demiplane, adding another 180 feet of radius to the demiplane each time.</para><topic level="8" name="Material Component: A Crystalline Sphere" origname="Material Component: A Crystalline Sphere" linkname="Spells_Epic_Spells_Non_Epic_Spell_Genesis_Material_Component_A_Crystalline_Sphere" docbookid="EpicSpells122" refname="Material Component: A Crystalline Sphere" reftype="other" refcase="yes" refaltname="" keywords="compon,crystallin,epic,genesi,materi,non-epic,spell,sphere"><para reftype="other" refcase="yes" refname="Material Component: A Crystalline Sphere"><i>Material Component:</i> A crystalline sphere</para><para><i>XP Cost:</i> 5,000 XP.</para><para/>
