The usual rules for ability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance apply. Unless otherwise noted in a description, it is assumed every plane has the normal gravity trait.</para><para><i>Heavy Gravity:</i> The gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, Balance, Climb, Jump, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks incur a -2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls. All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a character's speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character's Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters who fall on a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.</para><para><i>Light Gravity:</i> The gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on the Material Plane. As a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their movements tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the light gravity trait take a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks. All items weigh half as much. Weapon ranges double, and characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb and Jump checks.</para><para>Strength and Dexterity don't change as a result of light gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These advantages apply to travelers from other planes as well as natives.</para><para>Falling characters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4).</para><para><i>No Gravity:</i> Individuals on a plane with this trait merely float in space, unless other resources are available to provide a direction for gravity's pull.</para><para><i>Objective Directional Gravity:</i> The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but the direction is not the traditional 'down' toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid object, at an angle to the surface of the plane itself, or even upward.</para><para>In addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The direction of 'down' may vary.</para><para><i>Subjective Directional Gravity:</i> The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on the Material Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of gravity's pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended objects and nonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on 'weightless' planes.</para><para>Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can move normally along a solid surface by imagining 'down' near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character 'flies' by merely choosing a 'down' direction and 'falling' that way. Under such a procedure, an individual 'falls' 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet in each succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to stop, one has to slow one's movement by changing the designated 'down' direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new direction in the first round and 300 feet per round thereafter).</para><para>It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity as a free action; this check can be made once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or she succeeds.</para><para/>

Time is always subjective for the viewer. The same subjectivity applies to various planes. Travelers may discover that they'll pick up or lose time while moving among the planes, but from their point of view, time always passes naturally.</para><para><i>Normal Time:</i> This trait describes the way time passes on the Material Plane. One hour on a plane with normal time equals one hour on the Material Plane. Unless otherwise noted in a description, every plane has the normal time trait.</para><para><i>Timeless:</i> On planes with this trait, time still passes, but the effects of time are diminished. How the timeless trait can affect certain activities or conditions such as hunger, thirst, aging, the effects of poison, and healing varies from plane to plane.</para><para>The danger of a timeless plane is that once one leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally, conditions such as hunger and aging do occur retroactively.</para><para><i>Flowing Time:</i> On some planes, time can flow faster or slower. One may travel to another plane, spend a year there, then return to the Material Plane to find that only six seconds have elapsed. Everything on the plane returned to is only a few seconds older. But for that traveler and the items, spells, and effects working on him, that year away was entirely real.</para><para>When designating how time works on planes with flowing time, put the Material Plane's flow of time first, followed by the same flow in the other plane.</para><para><i>Erratic Time:</i> Some planes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he moves between the two planes.

These borders may adjoin other planes or hard, finite borders such as the edge of the world or a great wall. Demiplanes are often finite.</para><para><i>Self-Contained Shape:</i> On planes with this trait, the borders wrap in on themselves, depositing the traveler on the other side of the map.

You can change the immediate environment as a result of tangible effort.</para><para><i>Highly Morphic:</i> On a plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that it's difficult to keep a particular area stable. Such planes may react dramatically to specific spells, sentient thought, or the force of will. Others change for no reason.</para><para><i>Magically Morphic:</i> Specific spells can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</para><para><i>Divinely Morphic:</i> Specific unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the ability to alter objects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with this trait. Ordinary characters find these planes similar to alterable planes in that they may be affected by spells and physical effort. But the deities may cause these areas to change instantly and dramatically, creating great kingdoms for themselves.</para><para><i>Static:</i> These planes are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane, nor objects that the denizens possess.

The elements are earth, air, fire, and water. The types of energy are positive and negative.</para><para>The Material Plane reflects a balancing of those elements and energies; all are found there. Each of the Inner Planes is dominated by one element or type of energy. Other planes may show off various aspects of these elemental traits. Many planes have no elemental or energy traits; these traits are noted in a plane's description only when they are present.</para><para><i>Air-Dominant:</i> Mostly open space, planes with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other elements. They usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas. Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant planes because they have little or no natural earth to connect with. They take no actual damage, however.</para><para><i>Earth-Dominant:</i> Planes with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive run the risk of suffocation if they don't reach a cavern or other pocket within the earth. Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet per turn). Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth dominant planes because these planes are tight and claustrophobic to them. But they suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</para><para><i>Fire-Dominant:</i> Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to Material Plane creatures, and those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.</para><para>Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage every round they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant planes. Those that are made of water take double damage each round.</para><para><i>Water-Dominant:</i> Planes with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can't breathe water or reach a pocket of air will likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant planes. Those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage each round.</para><para><i>Positive-Dominant:</i> An abundance of life characterizes planes with this trait. The two kinds of positive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy swirling through the plane. All individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2 as an extraordinary ability.</para><para>Major positive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane grants fast healing 5 as an extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full hit points gain 5 additional temporary hit points per round. These temporary hit points fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive- dominant plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round that its temporary hit points exceed its normal hit point total. Failing the saving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, killing it.</para><para><i>Negative-Dominant:</i> Planes with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of travelers who cross them. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color and filled with winds bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. As with positive-dominant planes, negative-dominant planes can be either minor or major. On minor negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of damage per round. At 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into ash.</para><para>Major negative-dominant planes are even more severe. Each round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative level. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or Hit Dice is slain, becoming a wraith. The <i>death ward</i> spell protects a traveler from the damage and energy drain of a negative-dominant plane.</para><para/>

Most of the inhabitants of these planes also have the plane's particular alignment, even powerful creatures such as deities. In addition, creatures of alignments contrary to the plane have a tougher time dealing with its natives and situations.</para><para>The alignment trait of a plane affects social interactions there. Characters who follow other alignments than most of the inhabitants do may find life more difficult.</para><para>Alignment traits have multiple components. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic) components; a plane can have either a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the specific alignment trait indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly evident.</para><para><i>Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned:</i> These planes have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be both good-aligned and evil-aligned.</para><para><i>Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned:</i> Law versus chaos is the key struggle for these planes and their residents. No plane can be both law-aligned and chaos-aligned.</para><para/><para>Each part of the moral/ethical alignment trait has a descriptor, either 'mildly' or 'strongly,' to show how powerful the influence of alignment is on the plane.</para><para><i>Mildly Aligned:</i> Creatures who have an alignment opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a -2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks.</para><para><i>Strongly Aligned:</i> On planes that are strongly aligned, a -2 circumstance penalty applies on all Charisma-based checks made by all creatures not of the plane's alignment. In addition, the -2 penalty affects all Intelligence-based and Wisdom-based checks, too.</para><para>The penalties for the moral and ethical components of the alignment trait do stack.</para><para/><para><i>Neutral-Aligned:</i> A mildly neutral-aligned plane does not apply a circumstance penalty to anyone.</para><para>The Material Plane is considered mildly neutral-aligned, though it may contain high concentrations of evil or good, law or chaos in places.</para><para>A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to all other moral and ethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the alignments than with accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly neutral-aligned planes apply a -2 circumstance penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based checks by any creature that isn't neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos, and once for good/evil), so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral, and chaotic neutral creatures take a -2 penalty and lawful good, chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a -4 penalty.</para><para/>

If the check fails, the spell does not function but is still lost as a prepared spell or spell slot.

A plane with the dead magic trait functions in all respects like an <i>antimagic field</i> spell.
