However, there are several methods by which extraordinary or unique monsters can be created using a typical creature as the foundation: by adding character classes, increasing a monster's Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods are not mutually exclusive-it's possible for a monster with a template to be improved by both increasing its Hit Dice and adding character class levels.</para><topic level="8" name="Class Levels" origname="Class Levels" linkname="Monsters_Improving_Monsters_Class_Levels" docbookid="Improving Monsters2" refname="Class Levels" reftype="other" refcase="yes" refaltname="" keywords="class,improv,level,monster"><para reftype="other" refcase="yes" refname="Class Levels"><b>Class Levels:</b> Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most commonly advance by adding class levels. Creatures that fall into this category have an entry of 'By character class' in their Advancement line. When a monster adds a class level, that level usually represents an increase in experience and learned skills and capabilities.</para>

However, improved monsters are individuals and often have better than normal ability scores, and usually make use of either the elite array or the nonelite array of ability scores. Monsters who improve by adding a template, and monsters who improve by increasing their Hit Dice, may use any of the three arrays (standard, nonelite, or elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be considered elite.</para><topic level="8" name="Elite Array" origname="Elite Array" linkname="Monsters_Improving_Monsters_Ability_Score_Arrays_Elite_Array" docbookid="Improving Monsters6" refname="Elite Array" reftype="other" refcase="yes" refaltname="" keywords="abil,arrai,elit,improv,monster,score"><para reftype="other" refcase="yes" refname="Elite Array"><b>Elite Array:</b> The elite array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
